# Statistical Analysis of Network Data - Notes

## What this is:

This repository is a collection of notes from my independent reading of the book :book: **Statistical Analysis of Network Data, with R** by Eric D. Kolaczyk in Summer 2019. 

## What this is for:

The goal of this repository is to build a foundation in the domain of network data with respect to statistical analysis, and a source of inspirations and ideas for the honors thesis in Math/Mathematical Statistics in my senior year.

## Contents:

As planned, there will be notes for each of the 10 chapters, with the exception of chapters 1 and 2, which are introductions.

1.  Introduction
2.  Manipulating Network Data
3.  Visualizing Network Data :heavy_check_mark:
4.  Descriptive Analysis of Network Graph Characteristics :heavy_check_mark:
5.  Mathematical Models for Network Graphs :heavy_check_mark:
6.  Statistical Models for Network Graphs :heavy_check_mark:
7.  Network Topology Inference :heavy_check_mark:
8.  Modeling and Prediction for Processes on Network Graphs :heavy_check_mark:
9.  Analysis of Network Flow Data
10.  Dynamic Networks

In each notes are key concepts: their big ideas and the general formulations, followed by examples in R. For convenience, the rendered pdf files are uploaded together with the RMD files.
